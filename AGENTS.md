# 🤖 AI Agent Engineering Log

This file tracks significant architectural changes, engineering insights, and critical fixes to provide context for future AI agents working on this codebase.

## 🛡️ Core Infrastructure & Security
- **2026-02-14: Prisma TLS Hardening.** 
  - Added explicit SSL controls (`PGSSL_ENABLE`, `PGSSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED`) in `lib/prisma.ts`.
  - **Context:** Prevents "self-signed certificate in certificate chain" errors common when connecting to managed DB pools (e.g., Supabase/Neon) from serverless environments.
- **2026-02-13: Supabase Storage Scaling.**
  - Updated configuration to support production-level asset management and scaling.
- **2026-02-13: GLM AI Client.**
  - Implemented environment-driven AI client selection for GLM integration.

## 🎨 UI/UX & Design System
- **2026-02-14: Dashboard Navigation Recovery.**
  - Restored legacy `Navbar` in `app/[locale]/dashboard/layout.tsx`.
  - **Insight:** The modern sidebar refactor accidentally hid `Edit Layout` and `Lock Grid` controls; reverting to the legacy navbar ensures these tools remain accessible for layout management.
- **2026-02-12: Monochrome & Glassmorphism Overhaul.**
  - Shifted away from standard Tailwind colors (emerald/rose for everything) to a premium monochrome aesthetic.
  - **Standard:** Use `white/5`, `white/10`, `white/20` for surfaces. Text uses `white/90` (primary) and `white/50` (secondary).
  - See `MONOCHROME_UPDATE_NOTES.md` for full design tokens.
- **2026-02-13: Home Page V2.**
  - Full landing page redesign using `shadcn` components for better pricing clarity and conversion hierarchy.

## 🚀 Recent Feature Updates

### 2026-02-14: Smart Insights Widget
- **What changed:** Added a new "Smart Insights" widget to the dashboard.
- **What I want:** Provide users with actionable, AI-driven feedback (e.g., risk warnings, opportunities) instead of just raw data charts.
- **What I don't want:** A static, boring widget that just lists numbers without context or intelligence.
- **How we fixed that:** 
  - Created a dedicated Server Action (`get-smart-insights.ts`) to simulate AI analysis of trading patterns.
  - Built a modern, glassmorphic UI (`smart-insights-widget.tsx`) that dynamically renders alerts and recommendations based on confidence scores.

### 2026-02-14: Sidebar Modernization
- **What changed:** Completely replaced the old dashboard sidebar with a new `shadcn/ui` version.
- **What I want:** A collapsible, responsive, and aesthetically premium sidebar that matches the new landing page design.
- **What I don't want:** The clunky, rigid legacy sidebar that had poor mobile support and didn't fit the "monochrome" theme.
- **How we fixed that:**
  - Implemented the `sidebar-07` pattern using the `SidebarProvider` context for smooth state management.
  - Refactored navigation into logical groups (Trading, Analytics, System) and added keyboard shortcuts (`Cmd+B`).
  - Proactively updated Teams layouts to ensure the new sidebar works everywhere, not just on the main dashboard.

### 2026-02-14: Dashboard Navigation Recovery
- **What changed:** Restored the legacy `Navbar` component to the dashboard layout.
- **What I want:** To keep the "Edit Layout" and "Lock Grid" controls accessible to users.
- **What I don't want:** Losing critical functionality because the new sidebar implementation accidentally removed the header where these controls lived.
- **How we fixed that:**
  - Re-imported and integrated the legacy `Navbar` into `app/[locale]/dashboard/layout.tsx` so it sits alongside the new sidebar, restoring full layout management capabilities.
- **2026-02-13: Trader Profile Spacing + Avatar Refresh.**
  - Refined `app/[locale]/dashboard/trader-profile/page.tsx` by removing the duplicate secondary top nav spacing and adding a `shadcn` `Avatar` in the profile card header.
  - **Context:** Fixes the perceived large top gap and improves visual identity/readability for the Trader Profile screen.
- **2026-02-13: Trader Profile Metric De-duplication.**
  - Removed repeated right-panel cards from `app/[locale]/dashboard/trader-profile/page.tsx` (duplicate Win Rate and Execution Quality repeats).
  - Added a labeled Consistency Rate row to keep the right panel informative without repeating stats.
- **2026-02-13: Trader Profile Payout-Based Profit Card.**
  - Removed the red-marked `Win Rate` and `Expectancy` quick cards from the left metrics row.
  - Replaced the right-panel `Avg. Win / Avg. Loss` section with `Total Profit (All Accounts Payouts)`, calculated by summing `PAID` and `VALIDATED` payouts across all accounts.
- **2026-02-13: Trader Profile Profit vs Withdraw Split.**
  - Split the summary into two distinct metrics: `Total Profit (All Accounts)` and `Total Withdraw (All Accounts)` in `app/[locale]/dashboard/trader-profile/page.tsx`.
  - `Total Withdraw` now counts only `PAID` withdrawals to keep it separate from profit metrics.
- **2026-02-14: Dashboard Editor Polish.**
  - Added back missing "Restore Defaults" and "Remove All" buttons in the widget editor navigation (`6ee3386`).
- **2026-02-13: PnL Visual Logic.**
  - Updated trade table PnL styling: Positive values now render in emerald for visual emphasis, while negative values maintain the muted monochrome style.

## 🛠️ Build & Type Safety
- **2026-02-14: Codebase Cleanup and Quality Pass.**
  - Removed 8+ redundant root files (`COMBINED_DOCUMENTATION.md`, `IMPORT_FIX_SUMMARY.md`, etc.).
  - Organized documentation by moving essential guides to `/docs`.
  - Deleted unused UI component `context-menu.tsx`.
  - Fixed 1300+ lint warnings primarily related to unused variables in Zustand stores.
  - Enhanced type safety in `trades-store.ts` and test files by reducing `any` usage.
- **2026-02-13: Vercel Build Fix.** 
  - Resolved i18n tooltip typing issues in commissions charts that were causing production build failures.
- **2026-02-13: Mobile Responsiveness.**
  - Optimized navbar triggers and filter groups for mobile screens to prevent layout overflow in `app/[locale]/dashboard/components/navbar.tsx`.

## 📌 Maintenance Notes for Agents
- **i18n:** Always use the `t` function with proper casting (e.g., `t as any`) in widget components to avoid complex translation object type errors until the schema is fully unified.
- **Tailwind:** This project uses Tailwind CSS v4 features. If you see `@config` or `@plugin` errors in the IDE, they are likely false positives from an older linter.
- **Zustand stores:** When creating or updating stores, avoid unused parameters (like `get` in the create callback) and use `unknown` or specific types instead of `any` for persisted state migrations.
